# Work Day Scheduler

## Introduction
This scheduler was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. I was required to create an interactive schedule that the user could edit and met all of the acceptance criteria (see Acceptance Criteria below).

Base code was provided for the start of this project (initial "index.html" and "style.css" files). All JavaScript logic was written from scratch.

## Description
* The current date is displayed at the top of the page.
* Work day schedule displays 1-hour time blocks, 8 AM - 6 PM.
* Each time block has a text-area to enter tasks/information.
* Each time block has a save button to save the text in that time block;
    * Clicking the save button will save that time block's information ONLY
* The work schedule is color-coded and dynamically changes depending on the current time:
    * Grey indicates past,
    * Red indicates present,
    * Green indicates future.
* All tasks are saved locally.

## Instructions
1. Navigate to "Work Day Scheduler" by clicking one of the links in 'Websites' section below.
2. Click on the text-area (center-column) to add information (e.g., tasks or reminders).
3. Click the *_blue_* 'Save' button (located on the right) to save your schedule.

* If you refresh the page, all saved information should remain.

## Installation
No installation required (see Websites below).

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
* THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a time block
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist
