# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This scheduler was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. I was required to create an interactive schedule that the user could edit and met all of the acceptance criteria (see Acceptance Criteria below).

Base code was provided for the start of this project (initial "index.html" and "style.css" files).

## Installation
No installation required (see Websites below).
